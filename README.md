## Context

This was built at MLH's NotUniversity Hacks. I am an avid participant in my school's quiz bowl team. Sadly we don't have any buzzers and purchasing buzzers for the whole team costs upwards of $1,000. I built this app so teams like mine can practise quiz bowl without a large upfront cost.
